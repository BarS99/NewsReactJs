# News in ReactJS

This project simulates a news website. It is using HTML, CSS (with Sass preprocessor) and JavaScript (with React + React Router v6).
Fetching data was handled using json-server (see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

In order to run the project please type following commands in your VSCode terminal once you've opened the project's root directory:
- npm start (start the server, port 3000 by default)
- json-server --watch src/vendors/json-server/db.json -c .\src\vendors\json-server\json-server.json (start the json-server to handle fetching, db.json contains data and json-server.json contains config).
